# Taxi

## Introduction

Taxi is an Android App being built using XML and C# on Visual Studio 2019.

The goal is to develop 2 apps. One will be for the drivers, and the other would be for the riders.
The app will work just the way Uber works, by allowing riders request a ride.
It will give the riders trip request to the drivers, and the drivers will have some time to accept the trip.
A started trip will show progress on Google map, which is integrated in the app.
A trip fare estimate and ETA would be calculated and displayed.

Taxi is still being developed. I am a studying web development but keen on being a self starter pushed me
to start buiding this app which is my first android development. The project was started in May 2020
